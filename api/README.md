## Functions

### cardinalDirection()

```ts
function cardinalDirection(degrees): CardinalDirectionType;
```

Defined in: [main.ts:93](https://github.com/phun-ky/cardinal/blob/main/src/main.ts#L93)

Returns the 8-point cardinal direction based on degrees.
Note: 0 degrees is EAST, increasing clockwise.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type     | Description           |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| `degrees` | `number` | The angle in degrees. |

#### Returns

[`CardinalDirectionType`](#cardinaldirectiontype)

- The 8-point cardinal direction.

#### Throws

Parameter cannot exceed 360.

#### Throws

Parameter cannot be lower than 0.

#### Example

```ts
const direction = cardinalDirection(135); // "south"
```

### cardinalDirectionCrude()

```ts
function cardinalDirectionCrude(degrees): CardinalDirectionCrudeType;
```

Defined in: [main.ts:127](https://github.com/phun-ky/cardinal/blob/main/src/main.ts#L127)

Returns the crude 4-point cardinal direction based on degrees.
Note: 0 degrees is EAST, increasing clockwise.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type     | Description           |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| `degrees` | `number` | The angle in degrees. |

#### Returns

[`CardinalDirectionCrudeType`](#cardinaldirectioncrudetype)

- The 4-point cardinal direction.

#### Throws

Parameter cannot exceed 360.

#### Throws

Parameter cannot be lower than 0.

#### Example

```ts
const direction = cardinalDirectionCrude(200); // "west"
```

---

### cardinalDirectionDetailed()

```ts
function cardinalDirectionDetailed(degrees): CardinalDirectionDetailedType;
```

Defined in: [main.ts:49](https://github.com/phun-ky/cardinal/blob/main/src/main.ts#L49)

Returns the detailed 16-point cardinal direction based on degrees.
Note: 0 degrees is EAST, increasing clockwise.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type     | Description           |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| `degrees` | `number` | The angle in degrees. |

#### Returns

[`CardinalDirectionDetailedType`](#cardinaldirectiondetailedtype)

- The 16-point cardinal direction.

#### Throws

Parameter cannot exceed 360.

#### Throws

Parameter cannot be lower than 0.

#### Example

```ts
const direction = cardinalDirectionDetailed(101.25); // "south-south-east"
```
