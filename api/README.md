```

Defined in: main.ts:18

Gives you the cardinal direction based on degrees.
Note: The degrees start at 0, which is EAST (originally, north should be 0, but here, north is 270),
and we travel clockwise.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type     | Description           |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------- |

### cardinal_direction_crude()

```ts
function cardinal_direction_crude(degrees): string;
```

Defined in: main.ts:57

Gives you the cardinal direction based on degrees (crude version).
